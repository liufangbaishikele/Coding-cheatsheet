## Reproducible coding

**Different attitudes toward coding documentation**

  1. It is neccessary because our memory is limited
  2. It takes time. Meanwhile, it helps to save time in case of trouble shooting and reproducible coding.
  
**The lesson I learned from bad documentation**
      
      * Software version
      
      * Working environment
      
      * Keep documentation updated
      
      * Make it into a good format and keep tracked
      
      * Using comments that make sense to the readers
      
      * Automatic documentation will be an efficient way
      
      * Never ignore error information just in case you come with the same error again
      
      * Generate README.txt file to illustrate where the input file from.
