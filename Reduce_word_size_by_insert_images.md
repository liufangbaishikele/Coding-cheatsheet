###  Reduce file size is a useful skill for researcher especially when submit for publication

**Tricks**

I have so many supplementary figures to combine into one word file. Each of the file have been compressed to lzw tiff file. 
However when I copy and paster them into my word file, they just make the word file way larger that I expected. The size of the word
is excessively larger than the total size of the figures I pasted

**Solutions**

Instead of copy paster the figures into my word file, I used ``insert`` figures function in word. It truned out work perfectely.
